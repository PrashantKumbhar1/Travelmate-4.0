## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for running a local server)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Live Server extension
- A Firebase project (set up Firestore and Authentication)

### Firebase Setup
1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project named "Travelmate".
   - Enable Firestore and Authentication (Email/Password provider).

2. **Configure Firestore**:
   - Create two collections:
     - `users`: For storing user data (name, email, mobile, createdAt).
     - `bus`: For storing bus data (e.g., name, from, to, departure, arrival, fare, seats, type, amenities).
   - Example `bus` document:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Express Bus 101",
       "from": "mumbai",
       "to": "pune",
       "departure": "14:00",
       "arrival": "18:00",
       "fare": 500,
       "seats": 30,
       "type": ["ac", "sleeper"],
       "amenities": ["wifi", "charging"]
     }
